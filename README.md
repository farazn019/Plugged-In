<h2>What Is Plugged-In</h2>
This is the repository for the Plugged-In Organization, 
which attempts to connect STEM Students and Business Students that are still in high school, with each other.

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
The tech stack that I used, while creating this application for <b>Front-End</b> was:
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
